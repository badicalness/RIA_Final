        Portable Magic is the national leader among booksellers. We ship across America from coast to coast and offer a broad range of books for all tastes, interests, and ages. From cookbooks to religion, childrenâ€™s educational books to romance, science to history - you will find it in on our website. 
        </br>
        At Portable Magic, we pride ourselves on being a community online bookstore. Literacy drives, educator discounts, library partnerships, book-fairs and books for the troops are just a few ways our online bookstore has pitched in over the past year. Please contact us at admin@admin.com to discuss how we can partner with you to build literacy, assist with a fundraiser, or run a book-fair to raise money for your school or organization.
